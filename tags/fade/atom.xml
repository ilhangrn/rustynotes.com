&lt;h2 id=&quot;eng-jump-in&quot;&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Eng&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;) Jump in&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately I have seen a video about people that are ceo or founder for big companies. They share same path, same methods. They do not wait for perfect time, perfect amount of knowledge and resource. When they 60 percent of it they jump in. They figure out the rest on the way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This appoach is the one. It works, I know. I tried several times, and managed to handle the case. Hero always turns from journey with wisdom, gain or experience. Waiting is the biggest problem I had, I still follow old habits. But I know, I have to jump. Jump in!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in a fight, in a storm, in a change, in a loss and in a win lately. They all together started to hit me. I have beaten some, failed several times. That much change is not easy to handle, even is not easy to digest, understand it&#x27;s existanace. Big changes are always struggle for us but static-boring life is also a struggle. Now you can expect the word balance. I will not try that. Send me all you have life. I will not be an easy target. I have lots of mistakes, failures. I can have more. No worries. Send me your new plans, lets fight with plans, dreams, tears and stupid sleep cycles. I will keep running even though I hate. I will punish myself before you do and I will reward myself in a way you can not imagine. In a most basic, most plain way none can think of it as reward. Who said we are same? Who said I like things? Who said I need a life? Just waiting in a bus station maybe, not for a bus, not for sitting. Just being here.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sorry, like i was from beginning of this journey. When i start writing, the first thing i remember is leaving, and need to say sorry. It seems like this posts are messages to friends to tell them something. But i know there is nobody there. As we say, person in distance is also distant from hearts, memories. Being forgotten is not something we can digest without pain. We all fade, now it is more clear for me. I used to live for people, mostly my people, but when they forget me how can i live. I don&#x27;t think but i hope there is someone i am living for.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

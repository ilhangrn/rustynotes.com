## (*Eng*) Looking back

Life was not something we imagine. It was a really hard pill to Swallow. We didn't know but even no-brainers will reach to end in some way. The important thing is what do you see when you look back in that point. When you shift that point through present from the end you will have a insight about your path and actions in that path. Back propagation of observe will reach to today and hit you. You may wish to go back to square one and live the life in proper in a better way. That will be beating a dead horse, there is no way to have totally happy or perfect life. Without problem and lackness nothing will have value and mean. So keeping eyes peeled and repeating the obverstion from future to past will help us to understand what we are doing and where we are going. This activity will probably prevent regret in the future. Life might seem a thing you can just go for broke and this might be right however we can feel more free by going future and looking back to shape our current days and decisions. Hope for that the imagination will set us free, at least from the present.

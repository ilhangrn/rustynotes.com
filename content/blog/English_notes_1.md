## (*Eng*) English study about entertainment

### Questions:
-   Where do you think the place is?
-   Would you want to read in a place like this?
-   Do you usually take a book with you when you're travelling or do you prefer e-book readers?
-   What's the nicest or most unusual place that you've spent time reading in?
-   Do you read much?


### Example answers:
-   I like all kinds of stuff as well -rock, pop, even some classical.
-   I don't tend to during the week, though, because I've got to get up early and basically my parents prefer me to stay at home.
-   Not as much as I'd like to, because I really love it - especially musicals. The seats are so expensive I can't afford to go more than a couple  of times a year.
-   I find it a bit boring. It's not really my kind of thing and I'm not very good at it either.
-   Probably less than I think I do. It's always on in the background, you know, but I don't pay much attention to it most of the time.
-   I will watch a big game if there2s one on and the occasional film, but apart from that, most of it's rubbish.
-   Yeah, I guess so. I generally cycle to college as well -unless it's raining.
-   I tend to watch films on demand through my TV at home.
-   Not as much as I used to.


### Vocab:
-   Now and again   -   ?
-   Tend to     -


### Habit's Grammer
#### Past:
-   To talk about past habits, we can use the past simple, used to + infinitive(without to) or would + infinitive(without to). Examples:
-   I listened to music all the time when I was younger.
-   I used to listen music all the time when I was younger.
-   I'd listen to music all the time when I was younger.
#### Present:
-   To talk about current habits we can use the present simple, tend to + infinitive(without to) and will + infinitive(without to)
-   I listen to music all the time.
-   I tend to watch films on demand through my TV.


### Adverbs and adverbal phrases for frequency:
-   always, all the time, constantly
-   normally, usually, as a rule, one the whole, by and large
-   sometimes, now and again, once in a while
-   almost never, very rarely, hardly ever, once in a blue moon
-   not as much as  + I'd like to / I want / I used to / I did before

### Making negatives for habits
-   We can make negatives with tend to and used to in different ways.
-   I didn't use to like it very much.
-   I never used to listen to music at home.
-   I tend not to go to the cinema that much.

### Mistakes:
-   Don't say *use to* or *used to* to talk about habits in the present. Ex:
    -   I (~~use to~~) **usually** / **tend to** go out with friends on a Friday.

-   Don't use the past continuous to talk about past habits. Ex:
    -   I (~~was going~~) **went** / **used to go** swimming a lot when I was younger.

-   Don't use *would* to talk about character and other kinds of states. Ex:
    -   I (~~would have~~) **had** / **used to have** long hair when I was younger.

-   Don't use *how* instead of as in comparatives. Ex:
    -   I don't go as much (~~how~~) **as** I'd like to.

### Did you know?
-   *Would* is actually far more common than *used to* to talk about past habits. That's because while we often introduce a topic with *used to*, we tend to give details with *would*. Ex:
    -   I **used to make** my own films when I was younger. **I'd watch** famous films and get ideas and then my brother and I **would try** to make our own versions. **We'd then do** screenings for our family.

### Ex:
-  By and large, I don't tend to watch TV much. There are too many ads, which annoys me.
-   I don't see her as much as I used to, because we're both so busy.

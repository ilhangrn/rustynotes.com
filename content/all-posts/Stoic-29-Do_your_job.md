## (*Eng*) Stoic-29 Do your job
> Roman emperor says that we need to do our job or task as they are our lost. We should get rid of distraction and overthinking going on all around. We will place our energy and effort to just one thing at a time. This is a clear approach for a clean result and good job. Our lives are full of distraction and fields we tend to worry and consider possible outputs in all of them. This issue is getting bigger and wider for all people. Nobody can get focus in a job in a certain period. It is impossible for most people. I aggree with the approach and keep it with me. As they say in my work, i have a laser focus. It will be so hard to distract me. I am lucky, wish you a better day which you can focus on your job that you need to do. Do what you need to do; you have to do. There are times in life we can not waste. If you are still young, you know.

## (*Eng*) Giving Control
> What do you do if someone touches your body, pushes, forces to somewhere to go. It is clear that noody likes it and nobody accepts this kind of things. But when it comes to mind, ideas, feelings, dreams, who has power on them. Do you thing you keep the control? Or is it shaped by social media, television, internet. Whats going on? Why we give them this right to have power on our own. We don't notice but we give it volunteerly. It is totally self-inflicted. We do that, like letting them touch you, hit you, push you, grap you to somewhere. Why don't we notice? Why don't we take care of this power and keep with us. If you are going to park, why they grap your attention with notifications and throw you out of park? Why do you allow, why?

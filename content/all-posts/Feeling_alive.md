## (*Eng*) Feeling alive
> My vocabulary is not rich to explain this feeling, i don't know how to explain it. I even don't know is there anyone feeling same, is there a word to explain my feeling. I don't think there is someone feels like me. Here and now. I feel alive, with someone inside me smiling, excited for living. It is not me i think. It is something growing in me.

> This things happens just i help a friend, i have a good time with a friend. When i cought fired and wanna run to everywhere, wanna use all seconds i have. To get more of it, to go the place they want to see me. The life i supposed to live. Fire will turn normal after some time. But memory will help me to set day. I live for the day i will meet my friends. I have nothing bigger. When i meet they should get smile, joy, power, courage, all we need.

> When i was a teenager. I was carrying hundreds of books in each travel to home. Now, my home is my friends. I will carry something they need, something they like for my whole life.

> There is no goal bigger than others happiness. People has no personal happiness. It is all about folk around us. We don't get happy. We make happiness. Yes, you cannot be happy. You make happy. Let me leave a poem from Emily Dickinson.

<br>
I'm nobody! Who are you?

Are you nobody, too?

Then there's a pair of us - don't tell!

They'd banish us, you know.

<br>

How dreary to be somebody!

How public, like a frog

To tell your name the > livelong day

To an admiring bog!

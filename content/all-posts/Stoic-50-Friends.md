## (*Eng*) Friends
> You know i have a friend. She did my first and most important two tattooes for me. One is core on my neck, it is me. A man in action seems like running, cycling, riding, flying. Looking up and aiming high. As i like to do.

> My other tattoo is One Piece nakama on my right hand. The most important thing shapes me, gives the power and hope. My friends, they are the most important thing i have. Like friends setting a journey in One Piece, all connected forever, trying to find the One Piece. Which i think they already found.

> There is a saying almost in all languages and cultures. It is like that, tell me with whom you consort and i will tell you who you are. I didn't know this saying belongs to Goethe. But he has more. Says, If i know how you spend your time then i know what might become of you.

> Let it be done, by you and by your source of power and hope. Which i missed a lot.

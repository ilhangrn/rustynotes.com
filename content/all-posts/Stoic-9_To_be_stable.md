## (*Eng*) Stoic-9 To be stable
> This one was kind of abstract topic. It is hard to remember the name and content. It says we need to create proper filters for us. They will be our base and will be used for judgement. We will not take inputs directly, instead we will select the correct one, the useful one for us. We will filter incoming things, and keep our system stable and on going. Otherwise the random and messy input will create garbage insidde even can cause corruption in some ideas, feelings and actions. Inputs we have are very important and our single option to get feedback from life to improve it. The input have to be proper. Be selective for the inputs. Do not get garbage.

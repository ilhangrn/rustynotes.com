## (*Eng*) Stoic-18 Life poetry
> To smell a flower we need to stop. We need to look around and find. The taste will find us itself. We will stop, search for it, find it, and get enjoy from life with this way. This is the way. Just passing through, just rushing will give us nothing. To catch, to create mean and taste we need to have a vision based on this wisdom. We need to look around different. Without search no one will find any taste from life. Change your vision, perspective to gather beauty from moments. Like writing a poetry, without different view no one can write it. Seeing the beauty requires a different-active look. Look around alive.

## (*Eng*) Stoic-32 Being hot headed
> He says: the nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength. What a great person is this Marcus Aurelius. What kind of emperor may have this wisdom to write it that clear! The writer is also a special person who digested all content and applied through life. He says "Remember, anger is not a power or strength. It is a mistake".

> Yes anger is a mistake. I was always in that mistake for first two decades of my life. I didn't know what is going on and no one has said that i am in a mistake which would cause my all problems. I think without that problem i would be a much better balanced person. The temper i had was enormous and distroyed almost everything.

> I understood something about this wekaness by time and developed a better approach to life. When i get angry i remember the old days which caused just damage. Then i remind myself a question. Is it worthed to get damage for something you pissed of? Being calm, even cold helps to body for handling more easily.

> I am sorry my body. I was an idiot and didn't know what was going on. I tortured you, caused wounds which will be with you forever. Forgive me body.

## (*Eng*) Inspired
> World is full of people inspired. Most are inspired by some historic people or living one. What that means? Showing a clue for person, for character. Nothing more. The thing we need action, becoming inspiring. Not staying inspired.

> We cannot stand with wrong, even if it is our internal wrong. We have to do the right thing. We can't just sit and wait. We can't lie and stay in peace. I am not sure how these poeple managing this conflict with thei ideal life, ideal partner, ideal person.

> I think the way to have an iamge in mind for future and behave in reverse is super hard for most people. Most are misserable in this, they just can't change and become ideal step by step. But there is another type. They stay away from virtues. They know they are lier, they know they just use others for their pleasure. They manage to do it again and again without hesitation. I don't know whether should we have regret or not? Is being lier and doing everything for goals fine? What kind of failure they will have. They hit the goals and never feel hesitation for the way. In short term and long term, they win. Why should we follow the virtues, follow the doctrin. It says society values being right and honest. But i don't think. If you don't shine with your lies and if don't cover your failure, weakness, the one with lies will come and pick up the prize. You will staying on side. As regular, basic person, you have no point in this race. So what? Why should we stay honest, humble, naive, friendly? Who likes this! People are looking for a fighter, they want adventure, not sitting in peace. And old doctrin is not workign anymore. There is no aggrement over honesty and loyalty. There is interest on joy and power.

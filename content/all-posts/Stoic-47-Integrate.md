## (*Eng*) Integrate
> He says it clear. We need to understand all about us and what is not about us. We need to integrate them. We need to understand and place them correctly. Over estimation and under estimation are both danger for us. You already have seen that you can handle most of the fears, you just keep yourself away by underestimating yourself and overestimating the fear. It has to be correct, otherwise all thinking, judgement, estimation is going to be problem for us. Failing is not that common like in our dreams and imagination. Most of the time we overcome the situation and smile for size of our fear in past. We see that they become part of history, solved, overcomed, succedded. Integration with our real true estimation would be great to keep going on our way. We need to know ourself, truely, all together.

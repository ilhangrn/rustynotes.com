## (*Eng*) Stoic-30 Turn off chase
> I said i am lucky for my focus. I am also gladful for being away from mass, not following series, news, popular contents. I feel more free than most people. But this is my own effort, i put tons of effort to reach here. Other things out of my control is still in progress to mass with my life. I am tried, exhausted. It is hard to live without nothing. I missed them but i will keep myself on the road out of main steam. I struggle but i will resist keep going to see what is there for me. I think there should be something pushing me to this path. I am chasing anything. I just left all to see what is outside.

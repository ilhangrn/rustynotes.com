## (*Eng*) Being me(n)
> Last post was 12 days ago. How? What was i doing that time?

> I don't remember. I did some study by skipping writing but it was just a few days. It seems like i lost the connection with this habit. I don't do it for fun and with fun. I have to do it. I can not heal myself otherwise. There is no one can hep me, can solve me.

> Today i watched a video in youtube in my desperate situation. It was nice to recover and set mind again. I am here - back by this video. Title is "Being Men". But i changed as "Being Me(n)"

> Because there was a saying in video. It says being avarage sucks. It really sucks when you tasted success at one point in your life. This is me.

> And you need to love pain. Mentally and physcologically. This is me.

> If you come here you have to put effort on it. Go hard. Or turn back to your country - your home. This is me.

> So i need to be me to be a men.

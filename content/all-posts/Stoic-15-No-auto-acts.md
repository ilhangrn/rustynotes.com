## (*Eng*) Stoic-15 No auto acts
> We live in a style which we don't consider much about what we do, how we do and why we do. We spend most of the time and also life with auomated actions even without noticing them. It seems most of people is like this and life spreaded around world is unnoticed and wasted unconsciously. We need to keep eye on our time, action, ideas, behaviours. They shouln't be out of habit. We need do what we do for our purpose and properly. We need to aware that we spend our life and our energy for something which serves to goal and has nice outcomes. A wasted life is just a waste. Don't cause a wasted life keep it a life. Stay alive. Live.

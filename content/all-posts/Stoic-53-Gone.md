## (*Eng*) Gone
> They say yesterday is past, tomorrow is future. Today is a gift. That's why we call it present. But i see the future, i live in a terrible future. It is not a healty and wonderful one. Today i went a store to change oil for car. When they ask my number, i couldn't remember the half.It is my own number which i use everyday. The only number i keep in memory and use every day for coffee order. How can you forget something like this?

> It is gone. It is settled. Future is done. It has been with for a long time and taking root inside. One day it will be bigger than me and capture everything. Memories, friends, jobs, and persona. Don't call me to fight, i am already in. And i am losing. I don't know what is gone. But it is gone. All will be gone.

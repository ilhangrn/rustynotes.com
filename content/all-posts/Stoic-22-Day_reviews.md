## (*Eng*) Stoic-22 Day reviews
> Looking to the last day and results of it then designing a the new one with lessons learned will give us more reflection and more awareness for life and moment. Like CI/CD, we continuously improve our life by tracking the problems and actions with their results. Perseverence is coming, for sure. Nothing can escape from continuous progress. When we look back, we should have mistakes there. It can be full of mistakes. Normal, we look to see and fix. We live for a better one.

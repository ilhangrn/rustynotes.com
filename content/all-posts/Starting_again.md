## (*Eng*) Starting Again
> I was in a fight, in a storm, in a change, in a loss and in a win lately. They all together started to hit me. I have beaten some, failed several times. That much change is not easy to handle, even is not easy to digest, understand it's existanace. Big changes are always struggle for us but static-boring life is also a struggle. Now you can expect the word balance. I will not try that. Send me all you have life. I will not be an easy target. I have lots of mistakes, failures. I can have more. No worries. Send me your new plans, lets fight with plans, dreams, tears and stupid sleep cycles. I will keep running even though I hate. I will punish myself before you do and I will reward myself in a way you can not imagine. In a most basic, most plain way none can think of it as reward. Who said we are same? Who said I like things? Who said I need a life? Just waiting in a bus station maybe, not for a bus, not for sitting. Just being here.

## (*Eng*) Slide
> We are in slide. Especially attention. It slides over bunch of things. It says in a point, sometimes for a long time like years, like all life. Imagine people with attention on people, events for a life. They never stayed on themselves, their own life, their own mind. Always checking outside and others.

> Another aspect of it, spending time and effort on things not yours, not related with you. Like spending to much time, money, effort on fixing a house that you rent. Isn't it strange? Why people focus on things which are not themselves or theirs. Still strange. People are lost. Will never get a right touch to life.

## (*Eng*) Jump in
Lately I have seen a video about people that are ceo or founder for big companies. They share same path, same methods. They do not wait for perfect time, perfect amount of knowledge and resource. When they 60 percent of it they jump in. They figure out the rest on the way.

This appoach is the one. It works, I know. I tried several times, and managed to handle the case. Hero always turns from journey with wisdom, gain or experience. Waiting is the biggest problem I had, I still follow old habits. But I know, I have to jump. Jump in!

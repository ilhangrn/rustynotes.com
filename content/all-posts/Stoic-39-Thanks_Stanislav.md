## (*Eng*) Thanks to Stanislav Petrov
> He was a soldier on control of machine to detect missle attacks and respond. He has seen a rocket launch in screen. The duty to respond this attack and trigger nuclear missle launch. He didn't. And waited to see, It was a signal noise in system. There was no missle coming. He disobeyed rules and didn't launch attack. He saved all of us. Each live in the world. We have a peace is from his hands. Thanks Stanislav.

## (*Eng*) Opinion
> He mentions a technique which i like and try to learn more about it. It is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, means a lot more than this three words. It is clean, our mental process over the events on life. It is so clear that we shape the value of event and make it nice or bad. When we lose this key it starts to get shape by fixed view. Most of us has negative fixed view and if we do not pay attention to our mental process over thing our outcome will be sadness, anger, bad feelings because of our filter. Almost every event can be seen in a different way, most probably in a better way in life. But it needs cognitive effort over input to process properly and get a useful output. We forget that.

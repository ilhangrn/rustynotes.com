## (*Eng*) Testing
> If we give something some value, especially some big value we test it. Think of money, we test it before change. But when it comes to ideas, feelings, thoughts we have, we don't test them. We don't check the source and value. It is crutial for our live but we underestimate and don't test. Before getting angry, before getting excited give yourself 2 seconds. Test it, test the value, source and fact.

> You remember old days, days with full of fast decisions, fast reactions, fast interactions of youthful days. Most were without wisdom and adequate judgement, testing. And most were the going to be regret for later. When you see yong people doing stupid things, you understand. They don't pay attention, they don't check, they don't test the value and source. They just live instictively. They waste, they fill their body and mind with worthless things.

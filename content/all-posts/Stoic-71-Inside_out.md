## (*Eng*) Inside out
> In and out are two of our perspectives. Having different perspectives helps us to see things in more clear view. Like walking aroung an object to understand what it is. How easy to judge and count things as wrong and as mistake. In which time? Things have different aspects and they usually change by time. Now you see, you see that we have nothing. How correct can be our ideas? With our single vision stamped by now. And have lots of different views in different people and times. What kind of mistake is really mistake? I mean not our mistakes, the things we count as mistake by others. Even our mistakes are not that clear. There is in and out, short term and long term. And feelings in us and others. It is not binary, we can not decide for most. We fail in most. And why, why we decide? Why don't we keep it as it is, letting it comes as it is as whole. With more views, we may see something truely. Maybe.

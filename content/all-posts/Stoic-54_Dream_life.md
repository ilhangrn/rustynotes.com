## (*Eng*) Dream life
> My life, is a dream. It is dream of billions of people. More than 5 billion of people dreams for the life a have. I want to have my life. I live in a dream, most of dreamers will never get a life like this. I have a lot. The coffee, the sleep, the old friends, the book, the computer, the languages, the gym, the character and so on. I focus on problems and progress, this my style. But don't forget what you have please. You have a dream life. 

> And the taste, the value of it comes from labor. It is not free, no one gave me any thing. Except my frieds, everything i have is them, is from them.

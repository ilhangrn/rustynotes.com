## (*Eng*) Ready
> Again Seneca, again great. Says that he doesn't want war, he doesn't like illness, but when it is here he wishes to do whatever he needs to do. To be ready to carry wounds nobly, bear all struggles, be ready.

> Today, i am here again. Ready one more time for the day. It will bring some, no matter what. I am here. Wherever i go there i am. With all peace inside, all potential inside. With all inside.

> And the degree on the wall is my shoe which means i walk. All in. This is my way, one.

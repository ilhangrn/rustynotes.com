## (*Eng*) Right Choice
> Where is good and bad? Is this important? Is there any evil, any good outside? Whether something rewarded, whether something will succeed. But whether it is the right choice!

> Good and bad. Is it real? Are they here, are they something we can know? Or are they just quick dense answers to cover all.

> The real thing is right choice. Not where it goes. Having a rational mind and focus only the choices.

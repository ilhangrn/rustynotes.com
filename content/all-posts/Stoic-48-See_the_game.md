## (*Eng*) See the game
> I see the game. As Seneca says, no slavery is more disgraceful than one which is self-imposed. We are all in a trap. Think about power. Since then they have power? Since social media? Since television? Since cinema? Since songs? Since newspaper? Since books? Since sunday or friday prays?

> Do you see the game? Where do all these desires come from? Why do you have desires, wishes, dreams, surges? What is a person in birth? 

> What is your future? How many steps of slavery will you climb or fall? Can you stop the rolling stone? Can you stay out? Is it going to smash everybody?

> You know what they say, money brings money and power brings power. Can you imagine how they have grapped the power. Someone in young age defined a true path and pushed hard. They it has escalated through generations. Not like our story. We didn't have someone knows the power, have access to it. What about being one?

## (*Eng*) Act is core
> This page is nice. It is about one of the most important things, action. I totally aggree. Action is core for all we have, all we get, all we are. We have to act for whatever issue is. Our action is the way, it is path. Nothing more will give us goals, destinations, results. Without action, any kind of effort is mostly waste. Waste of a life has taken an action. Like my great t-short says 'Take Action'.

> Next page is about actions again. But actions shaped by knowledge, generated by processing ideas, actions shows your character, your wisdom, your discipline. Like our shoulders showing our gym habits and effort, our actions should show our knowledge, our expertise, our approach to life. Give yourself time to digest theories you get and put effort to get outcome. Use it to shape yourself, to shape your actions, your life.

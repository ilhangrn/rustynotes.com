## (*Eng*) Stoic-5 Who where why
> We need to ask so questions and think about some core values. Who we are, what are we doing, why are we here, where are we heading. Know yourself, your life, your nature. If you don't, no one can know and guide through life. You need to know yourself to guide properly, to understand and manage correctly.

## (*Eng*) Jose Mujica
> This page was about money and spending. We all know some super rich people and how much they spend for their basics and luxuries. It is so simple to spend when we give someone lots of money. Having parties, buying lots of stuff. But what about Jose and Seneca. Seneca sold furniture in palace to pay dept, Jose donated 90 percent of his money with his car to charity. I met him once in Istanbul, and i will never forget him. He is a real person with great pain and still good. Spend years in prison, spend almost all he has for country. He knows that is real in this life. Real thing is how you feel. Not spending and buying. You can not buy yourself. You need to create.

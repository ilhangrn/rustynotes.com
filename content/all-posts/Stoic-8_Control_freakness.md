## (*Eng*) Stoic-8 Control freakness
> we-people assume that life is ours. This is our life and we will make it as we like. We try to control whatever we can to reach our goal, to reach our desired life. Life is for us and we should be able to control and push it to the point we want. But, life is not for us. Life is not ours. We control almost nothing. We change almost nothing. Life is there and keep going, even without us. We have no control almost anything. We have just a very small amount of control on our some ideas and behaviours. The thing we can do managing and shaping them, nothing more. Put effor to the things you can change.

## (*Eng*) Stoic-27 Put energy
> I don't have access to computer every day. It is limited and i prefer spending this time with learning instead of reading, not even writing. But i promised myself i will do it. I need to catch, at least read all of them which can be useful in my life. The last page i have read is about essential fields i need to put energy and thougth. First field is what i like and dislike. Second field is what is my act, impulse, action. And last field is judgement. What is the reason. All are connected and shape day-life. Put energy and thought to them.

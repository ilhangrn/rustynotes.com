## (*Eng*) A man far away
> There is a video hitting hard. He talks about a man who chooses to walk alone and stays untouched. When you meet a man with few friends or not at all, don't mistake it as a weakness. One genuine friend holds more value than hundreds of phony. His trust is earned. His value is time, treating it like royalty. His power comes from within. That someone you don't wanna come across. He has seen fake friendships, drama and betrayal in others. He is completely his own. He does not need your approval. While others chase validation he has cut it all out.

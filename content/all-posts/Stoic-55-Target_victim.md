## (*Eng*) Target victim
> Boss is frustrating, work is overwhelming? It seems like they are, but you are the one creating this perception and taking up these feelings. It seems like something from outside is annoying you, disturbing. But you are the one creating this and targeting them. They are just your target to blame, to throw guilty out. 

> As Mello says, the cause of my irritation is not in the person but in me.

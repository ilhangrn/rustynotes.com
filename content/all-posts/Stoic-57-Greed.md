## (*Eng*) Greed
> Greed is sickness. It will eat you from inside. If you don't have rational mind or suspend it, sickness will grow. It will empty all feelings you might have. It will capture you. Just an awaken, just a rational mind can regulate it, can stop it. Nothing can be like greed in destroying. It can destroy everything, all you have, all we have, all world have. Greed is total sickness, total sickness. Requires great attention. Don't let it seed, don't let it grow. Stay ratioanal.

> Don't forget, the day, the life is the field of experience what you have learned. You know if you always want more, fight, struggle for more, you will never get free. Greed kills freedom. Stay rational, stay free.

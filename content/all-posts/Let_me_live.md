## (*Eng*) Let me live
> I am sorry, like i was from beginning of this journey. When i start writing, the first thing i remember is leaving, and need to say sorry. It seems like this posts are messages to friends to tell them something. But i know there is nobody there. As we say, person in distance is also distant from hearts, memories. Being forgotten is not something we can digest without pain. We all fade, now it is more clear for me. I used to live for people, mostly my people, but when they forget me how can i live. I don't think but i hope there is someone i am living for.

> Sorry.

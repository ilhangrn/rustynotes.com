## (*Eng*) Stoic-20 Ignite again
> It happens to all of us. We all fail and drift from our path. It is normal, it is part of journey. The fire seems so weak, like to fade and disappear. This fire is different, it is not that easy to vanish. It is the fire of life, the fire of will, the fire of hope. Fire of our soul, fire of our life, fire of our existence. We know how to set it again and again ever time. We did several times. We set great fires, hit great goals dispate of all obstacles and fails. The only thing we need stand up again again, ignite again and again. Burn and turn to future.

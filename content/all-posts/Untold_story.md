## (*Eng*) Untold Story
I was studying python programming and have seen the saying "There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you." from Maya Angelou. I have searched for the meaning of agony and it means extreme physical or mental suffering. I have thought about the meaning of this saying and I have realized that it is true. I am getting rid of the burden on my shoulders by this kind of great inferences about life. Otherwise we strugle to reach the point they have already reached and understood.

Shoulders and missing, needs more care, more understanding for basement of future. I will write later..

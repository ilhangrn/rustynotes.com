## (*Eng*) Stoic-3 Saying No
> The third component in the book is about saying no. We have goals and paths through our life. We will always find something staying on the road and blocking our progress. They can any kind of feeling like anger, anxiety, depress. We need to say no to them and their sources, to people causing them. To people asking for something whichwill keep us away from our target. Don't lose your path,be aware of obstacles and misguiding. Say no to misguided feelings, wasted time and blocked paths. Say no to anybody is going to cause them.

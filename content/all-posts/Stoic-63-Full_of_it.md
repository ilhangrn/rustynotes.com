## (*Eng*) Full of it
> Yes live is full of people, problems and combinations of them. We know it, we know very well. From beginning to end. It is same, it is full of them. But we forget, i don't know how we forget why we forget, we forget that and start to get angry, get annoyed. Why?

> And we have one more problem. We are fast. Super fast to give opinion to pick a side, to judge. What kind of experience and wisdom we have? Why is this rush?

> We know life has poeple, people has problems, we have judgements. Great mix to create mistrust, misjudgement, misleading feeling. So easy to get annoyed, so easy to get angry, so easy to throw shit. But we forget us, we could keep calm for 2 seconds before planting anything. When you plant any feeling it is too late to remove, it will grow immediately. Give yourself 2 seconds before any kind of judgement and feelings. Don't forget life is life. Full of it.
